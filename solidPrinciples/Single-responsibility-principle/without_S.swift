 EXPLANÄ°NG OF SRP
  
 The program above does not follow SRP because RegisterUser does three different jobs: register a user, connect to the database, and send an email.

 This type of class would cause confusion in larger projects, as it is unexpected to have email generation in the same class as the registration.The program above does not follow SRP because RegisterUser does three different jobs: register a user, connect to the database, and send an email.
